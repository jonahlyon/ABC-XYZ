# Premise
For a future phase 3 study (study 305), client ABC would like some PK study support - they are wondering what the best sampling schedule might look like for a US study with primarily obese patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction.  The study will be with drug ABC-XYZ, a oral small molecule which has amazing preliminary results showing efficacy for late-stage pancreatic cancer. An existing PopPK model has been developed for ABC-XYZ (run 1001.mod).

Using known variability, the client is hoping to first identify a sound sampling scheme and second, demonstrate that the chosen sampling scheme yields minimal bias in key parameter estimates, namely clearance and central volume.
