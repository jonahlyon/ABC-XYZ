# ABC-XYZ
ABC-XYZ is an existing oral small-molecule drug aimed at treating primarily late-stage pancreating cancer.  As an unmet need in the pharmaceutical market, this product has an exciting future.

This product is not without its faults.  ABC-XYZ has a highly variable PK profile between subjects and individual PK sample assays are not only expensive but unreliable and highly variable.  Additionally, this product has efficacy and safety concerns for subjects with various levels of hepatic dysfunction (~ 12% lower drug clearance for subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction).  Finally, the group is also hoping to widen the accessibility of the drug to a larger patient population, including obese patients, which will prove difficult with the variability in PK.

# Study 305
Company ABC is hoping to conduct a phase 2 U.S. trial with particularly subjects who are obese and have various levels of hepatic dysfunction.  This study will enroll approximately 120 subjets.  It is estimated that 80% of the subjects will be white, 15% will be Black or African American, 3% will be Asian, and 2% will be other races.  We are predicting an enrollment with slightly more females than male (52% female). 4.8 mg (QOD), and 7.2 mg (QOD) doses in a fasted state have been approved for phase 2 studies.
